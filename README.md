# Notebook for the feature correlation workshop I gave at Insight

What is feature collinearity/correlation? Can it hurt my machine learning efforts? Short answer is, yes, for linear models. 
Head over to the notebook to see how to measure multicollinearity and how to combat it.

<br> Additionally, I have implemented some useful functions for computing correlation between categorical features and categorical/numerical features.
